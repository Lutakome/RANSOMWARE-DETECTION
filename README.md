# ** RANSOMWARE-DETECTION **

Ransomware is a malware designed to deny a user or organization access to files on their computer. By encrypting these files and demanding a ransom payment for the decryption key, cyberattackers place organizations in a position where paying the ransom is the easiest and cheapest way to regain access to their files. 
Ransomware attacks pose a significant threat to organizations worldwide, causing data breaches, financial losses, and operational disruptions. In this analysis, we will explore how machine learning techniques are revolutionizing the detection and mitigation of ransomware threats. By leveraging advanced algorithms and predictive analytics, machine learning enables organizations to detect ransomware infections early, identify ransomware variants, and predict future attacks with greater accuracy. We will delve into the key methodologies and approaches used in ransomware detection, including behavior-based analysis, anomaly detection, and signature-based detection. Through real-world example and case study, we will illustrate how machine learning algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data, detect ransomware patterns, and adapt to evolving threats in real-time. Join us as we uncover the potential of machine learning in enhancing ransomware detection capabilities, strengthening cybersecurity defenses, and safeguarding organizations against the growing menace of ransomware attacks.
